## Title: Gene Expression Analysis and Functional Enrichment of Differentially Expressed Genes in Glioblastoma Cells‚Äù
## Background
Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common and aggressive malignant brain tumor in adults. It arises from astrocytes, cells that support neurons. GBMs are fast-growing, invasive tumors that make up about half of all malignant CNS cancers, posing significant treatment challenges.
Understanding gene expression patterns is crucial for advancing glioblastoma treatment due to the tumor's complex biology and aggressive nature. By visualizing gene expression data through heatmaps and conducting functional enrichment analysis, researchers can identify differentially expressed genes and their associated biological pathways. This insight can reveal potential therapeutic targets and mechanisms of resistance, guiding the development of more effective treatments.
